# ðŸ‘‹ Hey â€” I'm **Rishi**
A student developer from India. I tinker with programming, math, and logic puzzles to learn how things work under the hood. Right now: fumbling my way through **C++** and training my problem-solving muscles â€” one pointer at a time.

**Math Â· Coding Â· Logic Â· C++**

---

## ðŸ”­ What I care about
- Learning how low-level stuff works (memory, pointers, algorithms)  
- Building small automation tools to remove boring tasks  
- Training a systematic problem-solving mindset through math & algorithms

## ðŸ§  What I'm learning (live)
```bash
rishi@learning ~ $ cat current_projects.txt
> Solving math problems & trying to understand algorithms
> Learning C++ fundamentals (pointers are confusing!)
> Building small tools to automate boring stuff
> Occasionally breaking things and learning from it
// I mostly code to understand how things work
rishi@learning ~ $ 
rishi@learning ~ $ learning c++
```

## ðŸ“š My journey so far
I started with Python because everyone said it was easy â€” and I struggled. The coding mindset clicked gradually when I began to think about problems differently. C++ is both frustrating and magical: memory management and pointers force you to think about programs differently. When something clicks after a long grind, it's the best feeling. Outside code, I love solving math puzzles and breaking hard problems into smaller pieces.

## ðŸ”¨ What I'm working on
- **C++ development** â€” memory, pointers, systems-level behaviour  
- **Math & algorithms** â€” practicing and improving problem-solving skills  
- **Web fundamentals** â€” small JS/browser experiments to understand the web
