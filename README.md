# ðŸ‘‹ Hey â€” I'm **Rishi** (`rishi_dev`)
A student developer from India. I tinker with programming, math, and logic puzzles to learn how things work under the hood. Right now: fumbling my way through **C++** and training my problem-solving muscles â€” one pointer at a time.

## ðŸ”­ What I care about
- Math â€¢ Coding â€¢ Logic â€¢ C++  
- Learning low-level details (memory, pointers, algorithms)  
- Building small automation tools to remove boring tasks

## ðŸ§  What I'm learning
```bash
rishi@learning ~ $ cat current_projects.txt
> Solving math problems & trying to understand algorithms
> Learning C++ fundamentals (pointers are confusing!)
> Building small tools to automate boring stuff
> Occasionally breaking things and learning from it
// I mostly code to understand how things work
